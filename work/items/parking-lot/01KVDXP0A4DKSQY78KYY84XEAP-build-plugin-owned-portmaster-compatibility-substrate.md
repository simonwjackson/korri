# Build plugin-owned PortMaster compatibility substrate

## Why it matters

PortMaster catalog search and package acquisition are now first-party, but ready-to-play ports still need manual launch adaptation on Bandai/NixOS. A plugin-owned compatibility substrate would let users install and launch PortMaster entries through generic Korri plugin seams while keeping Korri core unaware of PortMaster-specific layouts, scripts, runtime packs, architecture quirks, and per-port compatibility overrides.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `@korri:portmaster` can install a selected catalog zip into writable Korri storage, verify it, and emit an installed-port manifest without Korri core knowing PortMaster layout details.
- [x] The PortMaster plugin provides a compatibility launch envelope for original PortMaster scripts, including control.txt, `/roms/ports` semantics, helper functions, shell compatibility, and safe device/helper stubs.
- [x] Native aarch64 ready-to-run ports such as Wordle SDL install and launch from catalog through plugin-owned normalization, ELF repair, and foreground presentation.
- [x] x86_64 ready-to-run ports such as Digger launch on Bandai through a plugin-owned FEX lane with bundled `libs.x86_64`, SDL backend handling, and foreground behavior.
- [x] Runtime-dependent RetroArch/libretro ports launch through plugin-declared dependencies and a plugin-owned runtime seam.
- [ ] Additional runtime-dependent ports launch through plugin-declared dependencies as FRT/Godot, Love2D, Mono, Java, GL4ES/WestonPack/GMloader runtime plugins land.
- [x] armhf lanes are supported through a plugin-owned qemu/rootfs strategy and validated with SkiFree on Bandai; 32-bit x86 remains future diagnostic/support work.
- [ ] Installed PortMaster games materialize as normal Korri library entries with launch, stop, logs, diagnostics, and compatibility metadata owned by the plugin.
- [ ] The phased plan in `work/items/parking-lot/01KVDXP0A4DKSQY78KYY84XEAP-portmaster-plugin-compatibility-substrate-brief.md` remains the handoff brief and each phase ends with a real Bandai launch milestone.

## Notes

Created after live Bandai smoke tests: Wordle SDL native aarch64 required shebang/ELF/display adaptation, and Digger x86_64 launched through FEX with SDL x11. User explicitly wants a plugin-owned approach where Korri core stays unaware and each phase has a launchable milestone.

2026-06-18 Phase 1 landed locally: added plugin-owned `portmaster.install` normalizer plus ZIP extraction, catalog MD5 verification, safe PortMaster ports-layout extraction, script/binary detection, and installed manifest emission. Live validation installed `wordlesdl.zip` from the packaged catalog, transferred the manifest tree to Bandai, applied the phase-allowed manual ELF patch/wrapper, and captured Wordle rendering from the installed tree.

2026-06-18 Phase 2 landed locally: added plugin-owned `portmaster.prepare-launch` envelope generation. The envelope writes `control.txt` and `tasksetter`, exposes both `$XDG_DATA_HOME/PortMaster` and `/roms/ports/PortMaster` semantics, provides helper/device stubs, and returns a bwrap/bash launch command for unmodified PortMaster scripts. Live validation launched the original `Wordle SDL.sh` (`#!/bin/bash` unchanged) through the generated envelope on Bandai and captured Wordle rendering.

2026-06-18 Phases 3-7 landed locally and were validated on Bandai: native ELF repair rendered Wordle SDL, x86_64/FEX rendered Digger, foreground presentation focused/fullscreened Digger, input compatibility ran generated `gptokeyb`, and RetroArch/libretro runtime compatibility rendered 2048 via generated `/usr/bin/retroarch` binding.

2026-06-18 Phase 8 completed the plugin-owned armhf/qemu lane: install-time armhf executable wrappers preserve originals under `.korri-qemu-arm/`, launch env prefers `DEVICE_ARCH=armhf`, and qemu/rootfs/library env is recorded in manifests and envelopes. Added `.#portmaster-armhf-runtime`, a plugin-owned Debian bookworm armhf SDL runtime package with `nix-support` metadata for rootfs, library path, qemu-arm, and env. Bandai verified qemu-arm can execute real PortMaster armhf helper binaries (`xdelta3.armhf`, `7zzs.armhf`), then launched `skifree.zip` through package-provided aarch64 qemu-arm and the package-provided armhf runtime. Screenshot `/tmp/portmaster-phase8-skifree5-screen-focused.png` confirmed SkiFree rendered.
