/**
 * Korri surface treaty — the boundary between Korri and a presentation surface.
 *
 * A surface is a self-contained front end (Shift is the first). It renders what
 * Korri can currently do and asks Korri to do things; it never reaches into
 * korrid, the Android bridge, portal state, or any Rust-generated type. That
 * one-way dependency is what lets a surface live in its own repository — or
 * eventually ship as an installable theme — without dragging Korri with it.
 *
 * Rules this file exists to hold:
 *   - Korri hands the surface a MODEL (what is true right now) and a HOST
 *     (what the surface may ask for). Nothing else crosses.
 *   - The model carries only facts Korri can actually produce today. A surface
 *     may render less than the model offers, never more than Korri knows.
 *   - Absent data is `undefined`, never invented. A surface decides how to
 *     present the gap (Shift draws a title monogram in place of cover art).
 *   - Commands are fire-and-forget. Korri publishes the consequence as a new
 *     model; the surface never awaits a result or holds Korri's state.
 *
 * This file imports nothing. It is the whole contract.
 */
