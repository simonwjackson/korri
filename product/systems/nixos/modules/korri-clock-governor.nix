# Shared CPU/GPU frequency-governor policy.
#
# Some Korri devices boot with `performance` governors on every CPU cluster
# and GPU devfreq node, pinning all clocks at maximum regardless of load
# (SM8550/Thor ships this way, and its fake-suspend wake path re-asserts it).
# This module owns a small root loop that keeps load-following governors
# applied: the kernel then scales each cluster to actual demand, which on
# Thor measured ~30C cooler and dramatically quieter under light loads with
# no measurable frame cost under heavy emulation.
#
# Scope discipline:
#   - The loop writes ONLY governor selection files. It never touches
#     scaling_min_freq/scaling_max_freq or devfreq min/max: per-game launch
#     hooks own frequency caps, and this module must not fight them.
#   - Re-asserting every poll makes external resets (suspend/resume hooks,
#     vendor scripts) self-healing within one interval, mirroring the fan
#     module's posture toward the same wake-path interference.
#
# Sandboxing note: identical to korri-fan-control — ROCKNIX guests mount /sys
# read-only at the mount level, so the loop best-effort remounts it writable
# and retries on failure; the sandbox does not reliably isolate that remount,
# and external ro flips are healed on the next iteration.
