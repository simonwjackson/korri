# `@korri:retroarch`

This plugin owns the RetroArch launcher across platforms:

- `plugin.ts` declares one `@korri:retroarch/retroarch` identity with Android
  and Linux implementations.
- `android/` obtains, patches, builds, verifies, and installs the signed
  `com.korri.retroarch` APK.
- Nix supplies the Linux RetroArch executable to korrid at deployment time.

Libretro cores are independent plugins. A library route selects this launcher
and a compatible runtime such as `@korri:mgba/mgba`; korrid composes them using
the runtime's explicit launcher and system compatibility declarations.

The APK temporarily carries the independently built Android mGBA `.so` so it
can install into RetroArch's private executable core directory. On Linux, Nix
supplies the independently packaged mGBA core. Neither packaging bridge makes
mGBA part of the RetroArch plugin.

Android session control uses a launch-derived high loopback UDP port and
nonce-bound HMAC-SHA256 frames. RetroArch rejects duplicate request nonces with
a fixed 32-entry ring reset for each launch authority. Korrid computes the
ROM's full-byte CRC32 while preparing the signed launch and requires both that
checksum and the normalized content basename in authenticated `GET_STATUS`
before resume or control materialization. While that active Android record
remains, status failures, different content, and different routes return an
`ActiveSessionConflict`; only positive process-end evidence clears authority
and permits a fresh start. SHA-based library identity remains a separate catalog
fact. MAC-covered status also reports native menu liveness and selection for
acceptance without making screenshots a pass criterion.

The launch token never crosses UDP, JavaScript, or logs. Android's
cross-process Intent handoff does unavoidably materialize it as a transient
Java String until RetroArch copies and wipes its native bootstrap storage.
Repository checks prove the patch/config/build contract; installed-device
behavior remains a separate acceptance gate.

## Distribution builds

`.github/workflows/retroarch-distribution.yml` builds and stages the custom
arm64 APK with `nix run .#ra-dist`. Relevant pull requests build an unsigned
candidate without secrets. Relevant `main` changes and manual `main` runs then
sign in a protected, checkout-free job and update a rolling prerelease named
from the APK's upstream version, such as `retroarch-v1.22.2-korri`. The rolling
tag moves forward as Korri patches change. Immutable release tags use the same
upstream-aware prefix plus a revision, such as
`retroarch-v1.22.2-korri.1`.

Configure these repository secrets before running the workflow:

- `RETROARCH_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `RETROARCH_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`
- `RETROARCH_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`
- `RETROARCH_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `RETROARCH_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256`

The certificate fingerprint and single-signer count are checked after the
isolated signing task, preventing a generated debug key, unexpected release
key, or additional signer from producing a distribution. Signing remains
outside the Nix store; Nix owns compilation, validation, and candidate staging.
Release secrets are materialized only in the checkout-free signing job after
compilation and an independent package, Activity, ABI, and bundled-core check.

Restrict the `retroarch-release` GitHub Environment to `main` and
`retroarch-v*` tags, protect `main`, and restrict creation of release tags.
Automatic rolling publication intentionally has no required-review pause. The
workflow removes the keystore before invoking artifact-upload code.
